The next C# source file is FileProcessingRequest.cs. This file doesn't have existing documentation, so let's create a new markdown file for it.

# FileProcessingRequest.cs

## Overview
`FileProcessingRequest` is a class that implements the `IRequest<ICollection<IMessage>>` interface from MediatR. It represents a request for processing a file in the Critical SQL Analysis Tool.

## Class Definition
```csharp
public class FileProcessingRequest : IRequest<ICollection<IMessage>>
```

## Dependencies
- `AutoGen.Core`
- `MDLabs.CriticalSqlAnalysis.Handlers.Commands`
- `MediatR`

## Properties

### FileProcessingCommand
```csharp
public IFileProcessingCommand FileProcessingCommand { get; }
```
Gets the command for processing the file.

## Constructor
```csharp
public FileProcessingRequest(IFileProcessingCommand fileProcessingCommand)
```
Initializes a new instance of the `FileProcessingRequest` class with the specified file processing command.

## Notes
- This class is part of the Mediator pattern implementation using MediatR in the application.
- It encapsulates a file processing command and expects a collection of `IMessage` as a response.
- The `FileProcessingCommand` property is read-only, ensuring immutability of the request once created.
- By implementing `IRequest<ICollection<IMessage>>`, it defines the expected return type for handlers of this request.
