# ReadProjectFilesRequest.cs

## Overview
`ReadProjectFilesRequest` is a class that implements the `IRequest` interface from MediatR. It represents a request to read project files in the Critical SQL Analysis Tool.

## Class Definition
```csharp
public class ReadProjectFilesRequest : IRequest
```

## Dependencies
- `MediatR`

## Properties

### ProjectPath
```csharp
public string ProjectPath { get; }
```
Gets the path of the project.

## Constructor
```csharp
public ReadProjectFilesRequest(string projectPath)
```
Initializes a new instance of the `ReadProjectFilesRequest` class with the specified project path.

## Exception
- Throws `ArgumentNullException` if the `projectPath` parameter is null.

## Notes
- This class is part of the Mediator pattern implementation using MediatR in the application.
- It encapsulates the project path from which files need to be read.
- The `ProjectPath` property is read-only, ensuring immutability of the request once created.
- By implementing `IRequest` without a type parameter, it indicates that handlers of this request don't return a response.
- The constructor validates the `projectPath` parameter to ensure it's not null, enhancing the robustness of the class.
