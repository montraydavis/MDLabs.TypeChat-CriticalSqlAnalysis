# AgentProcessingOptions.cs

## Overview
`AgentProcessingOptions` is a class that represents the processing options for the agent in the Critical SQL Analysis Tool.

## Class Definition
```csharp
public class AgentProcessingOptions
```

## Dependencies
- `System`

## Properties

### Temperature
```csharp
public float Temperature { get; set; }
```
Gets or sets the temperature for the language model. Default value is 0.25f.

### Timeout
```csharp
public int Timeout { get; set; }
```
Gets or sets the timeout for the language model in milliseconds. Default value is 30000 (30 seconds).

## Notes
- This class is likely used to configure the behavior of the AI language model used in the analysis process.
- The `Temperature` property affects the randomness of the model's output. A lower value (like the default 0.25) makes the output more focused and deterministic.
- The `Timeout` property sets a limit on how long the model can take to generate a response, helping to prevent long-running operations.
- Both properties have default values, allowing for easy instantiation with reasonable defaults.
- The class is part of the `MDLabs.CriticalSqlAnalysis.Models.Options` namespace, indicating its role in configuration within the larger project structure.
